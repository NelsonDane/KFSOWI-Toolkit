# KFSOWI-Toolkit
A set of tools to install TWRP (Which allows custom ROMS to be installed) and Roots the Kindle (All supported FireOS versions) with SuperSU. Also includes other tools for installing Xposed, Nova Launcher, and undoing anything you did with the tool (Including returning to stock). Only works on the Kindle Fire 3rd gen (Soho/KFSOWI).

## Welcome to the KFSOWI TWRP Tool!

This tool was developed by me using commands by spudowiar. The reason we have TWRP for the KFSOWI is because of them. This tool automates the install of TWRP 2.8.7.0 from spudowiar's guide. For some reason the newest TWRP image didn't work and was slow and glitchy (I tried it.)

### In order to use this tool you must have:

1. An unrooted Kindle Fire HD 3rd generation soho or KFSOWI running Fire OS 4.5.5.2. (Using this tool will root your device with SuperSU)
 
To find out if you have the KFSOWI, download the app “Android Terminal by linxmap” from the Amazon Appstore. Then run “getprop ro.product.device” without the quotes. Look for “soho” in the text that follows. If you don’t see soho, don’t use this tool or it may brick your device. 

2. A Unix Terminal (Linux Terminal, MacOS Terminal, Windows WSL)

That’s it! You are now ready to install TWRP and SuperSU!

#### DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BRICKED DEVICES!!!!! Only use this tool on the KFSOWI/soho Kindle Fire 3rd Gen. Do not use on any other device. 

### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Clone the repository and cd into it

2. Type sh and drag the Final KFSOWI TWRP Tool.sh file (Or any other tool you want to use) into the Terminal window. Hit return. 

3. Follow the instructions in the terminal until the end. 

## NOTE: I created this in 2017. I'm uploading this now because I got rid of my Kindle but thought that other people might benefit from this tool. This will not be updated by me since I don't have my Kindle anymore, but feel free to use and modify to fit your current needs!
